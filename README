	Device Driver Framework

SYNOPSIS
	N/A

DESCRIPTION
	This project is a test bed and demonstration unit for how to write
	basic boot-ready servers on Minix, and this project allows you to
	communicate with the echo server using a special echo client.

NOTES
	This project requires patches to the Minix kernel.  These patches
	have not been added directly to this project, but they will be.

BUILD
	First, execute `gmake patch_TARGET' to integrate this project into
	an existing project.  Some examples of supported patch targets:
		- patch_minix: Integrates this into Minix 3.1.2a

	Once integrated into an external project, you will need to follow the
	normal build procedures for the existing project and this project
	will be built along with it.  However, to install some special code
	that may not be built or installed with existing projects, execute
	`gmake build install'.

	To get debugging builds of any of this code, execute any of the
	previous `gmake' statements with `DEBUG=1' in front of the command.

	See SYNOPSIS for a brief usage guideline of any utilities built by
	this project.

LOG
	01/12/2007:
	Log has been suspended since it's updated on the web site for now...
	Expect it to be resumed when we start making major releases.

	12/24/2006:
	Finished running some tests to make sure preliminary C++ IPC support
	worked, and it did.  I know some things are going to need to be
	added, but I will do that on an as-needed basis.

	12/23/2006:
	Began adapting this code from an earlier "echo" project that tested
	boot-ready servers on Minix.  Some C++ has been written that should
	allow for C++ clients and servers to use the IPC facilities of Minix
	and other microkernel OS (or any OS that implements some sort of IPC
	facilities).
