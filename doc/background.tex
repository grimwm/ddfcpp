\mychapter{Background}

A microkernel operating system is a set of user-space servers built on top of
an existing microkernel~\cite{stallings2005}, such as Mach or L4, with one
critical service being the device driver framework.  The device driver
framework is the backbone service for all devices in the system, providing
a common way for device drivers to access devices and input/output (I/O)
buses on behalf of requesting clients.  However, to better grasp a
general understanding of microkernel operating systems, a brief background
on their development is required.
