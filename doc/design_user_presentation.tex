\mysection{User Presentation}

To the user, the DDM represents the drivers scattered in memory as a coherent
hierarchy.  In \figurename~\ref{fig:ddm_layout}, busses are internal nodes
while devices are leaves.

The DDM provides facilities for searching the tree in order to make finding
a driver or set of drivers easier.  For example, a client can ask the DDM
for a list of drivers attached to the PCI bus, and the DDM will return the
set of drivers claiming to belong to it.

All top-level independent drivers must attach to a special {\important null
bus} supported by the DDM.  The null bus provides a central access point into
the tree so that when a client wants a listing of all drivers on the
system, it can begin by enumerating all drivers on the null bus.  Mostly
bus drivers will be connected to the null bus, but other drivers that do not
directly depend on bus drivers for operation, such as a keyboard driver, can
also be found on the null bus.
