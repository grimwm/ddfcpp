{\em Most modern operating systems have the tendency to be complicated and error
prone because device drivers operate in close proximity to the operating
system kernel.  This paper implements and tests a method for making the
execution of device drivers more robust by placing them in a controlled
environment and strives to set an example for how modern operating systems
should approach this task.

With drivers in a controlled environment, they are simpler for software
developers to implement since they will no longer need to worry about
unintentionally corrupting the operating system kernel.  The advantage to this
is that drivers should no longer be the primary cause of operating
system freezes that cost users time and money.}
