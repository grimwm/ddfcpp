\mysubsection{Device Driver Manager}

The device driver manager is a server task that manages
drivers and allows other tasks to find and gain access to them.
Due to the fact that the DDM is the core process in the DDF, the DDM is
resilient to failures of devices or their drivers.

Since all drivers reside in their own address space and are assumed to
reside on the same system, the DDM does not need extensive fault tolerance.
When a process unexpectedly dies and another process tries to communicate
with it, the process manager will tell the calling process why the call
fails.  Likewise, when a failure is recognized, a log message is generated,
and it is up to the administrator to resolve the problem.  However, since
the existing implementation of this design is on Minix 3, Minix's
reincarnation server (RS) can reincarnate processes that have died
unexpectedly. Such allows for a large degree of fault tolerance.
