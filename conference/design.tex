\mychapter{Device Driver Framework Design}
\label{sec:design}

The {\important device driver framework} (DDF) design contains
three primary components: an interprocess communication (IPC)
library that provides common methods for DDF communication, a
{\important device driver manager} (DDM) that monitors device drivers
registered with it, and a keyboard snooping driver that tests the correctness
of the framework.  \figurename~\ref{fig:ddf_layout} presents an overview of
the DDF. An in-depth discussion can be found in  the following subsections.

It is very important to realize that the DDF's primary purpose is not
to improve the raw performance (speed) of existing frameworks, but
merely to enhance the safety of driver execution and simplify the
driver implementor's task.  Performance is an important secondary
goal, so the DDF should either maintain or exceed current performance
levels seen in existing second-generation microkernel OS's.

%\mychapter{Device Classes}
\mysubsection{Device Classes}

In our framework, there is no distinction amongst whether a driver is block, character, or raw;
% Originally, these three classes were going to exist, but 
%it was discovered
%during implementation that 
in the context of our framework, these classes are only relevant to higher level
subsystems (such as the file system) which do not affect driver operation.
In fact, drivers are each free to interact with the hardware in any way
they see fit.

%\mychapter{Device Scheduling}
\mysubsection{Device Scheduling}

Device drivers each have a first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue where requests to
use the device are sent.  This allows the drivers to pull new requests from
a single location one at a time while clients are allowed to add new
requests in parallel.

%In some monolithic OS, drivers themselves have direct
%access to this queue so that requests can be reordered to maximize performance;
%unfortunately, the current implementation of the DDF does not support this due
%to lack of capability in Minix 3 for it.  In fact, had drivers attempted
%to access multiple items in its queue using Minix 3's {\code receive()} call,
%the driver would have suffered a high likelihood of live-locking.

The framework is not designed to allow client processes to directly lock
drivers for exclusive use.  The reasons for this include avoiding a
performance penalty that would have occured by always having to check bits to
see if the calling client had appropriate access rights and because it was
intended that security be appropriately handled by other OS subsystems.  In
fact, the primary responsibility of this DDF is to provide ``utility'' to
driver writers and to leave security to dedicated subsystems.  An example of a
subsystem that could properly handle security for device driver access is a
device file system similar to FreeBSD's devfs\footnote{Provides a file
system-level interface for client processes to access device drivers.}.
This both simplifies the design and makes it more robust by concentrating on
one task only.
